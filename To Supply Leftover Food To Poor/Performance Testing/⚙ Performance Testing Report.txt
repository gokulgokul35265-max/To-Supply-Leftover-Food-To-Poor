Project Title:

Smart Waste Management System using IoT and Data Analytics

1. Objective

The main objective of the Performance Testing Phase is to evaluate the efficiency, reliability, and responsiveness of the Smart Waste Management System under different load conditions. The goal is to ensure that the system performs smoothly in real-time environments.

2. Purpose

Performance testing helps verify that the IoT sensors, cloud services, and web application components of the system work efficiently together without lag, data loss, or breakdowns.

3. Scope

This phase focuses on measuring the performance of:

IoT sensor data transmission speed

Cloud database response time

Web dashboard loading time

Route optimization algorithm efficiency

4. Types of Performance Testing Conducted
Test Type	Description	Expected Result
Load Testing	Measured how the system behaves with multiple bins transmitting data simultaneously.	Should handle up to 100 IoT bins without delay.
Stress Testing	Checked system stability when data exceeds normal load limits.	Should remain functional under extreme load.
Endurance Testing	Verified performance over long durations.	No memory leaks or slowdowns after 24 hours.
Scalability Testing	Evaluated how well the system scales with additional users and bins.	Linear performance with resource scaling.
Response Time Testing	Measured dashboard response to new sensor data.	Updates within 3 seconds of data entry.
5. Tools Used

Apache JMeter – For web and API load testing

ThingSpeak / AWS Cloud Monitor – For IoT data performance analysis

Postman – For backend API performance checks

Google Chrome DevTools – For frontend performance profiling

6. Performance Metrics
Metric	Measured Value	Target Value
Average Response Time	2.3 seconds	≤ 3 seconds
Data Transmission Delay	1.5 seconds	≤ 2 seconds
CPU Utilization	60%	≤ 75%
Memory Usage	500MB	≤ 700MB
Data Accuracy	98.5%	≥ 95%
7. Observations

The system handled real-time data from multiple IoT nodes efficiently.

No significant lag was observed during route optimization or dashboard refresh.

Cloud synchronization performed well within the expected latency range.

Memory usage remained stable during continuous operation.

8. Issues Identified and Resolutions
Issue	Cause	Resolution
Occasional delay in data update	Network latency	Optimized data packet size and retry interval
High CPU load during peak hours	Excessive route computation	Added caching mechanism and async processing
Sensor data loss in unstable Wi-Fi	Connection timeout	Implemented buffer storage for retransmission
9. Conclusion

The Performance Testing Phase confirms that the Smart Waste Management System performs efficiently under varying loads and real-world conditions.
The system meets the defined performance metrics, ensuring reliability, scalability, and real-time responsiveness required for urban waste management operations.
